## Summary

clfs-embedded is a book that talks about building an embedded system from scratch. [The original project](https://clfs.org/view/clfs-embedded/) has been archived and is no longer updated. This is an attempt to continue its legacy. I've modified the DocBook source [available here](https://github.com/michele13/clfs-embedded/). To see a rendered result go [here](/clfs-embedded)

Recently I've rewritten the book in restructuredText format and rendered it with sphinx. The code can be found [here](https://github.com/michele13/clfs-sphinx/), while [the rendered version is here](/clfs-sphinx/latest/)
