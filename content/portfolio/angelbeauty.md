A Copy of template #73332 (Angel) from [templatemonster](https://www.templatemonster.com/woocommerce-themes/angel-beauty-salon-store-woocommerce-theme-73332.html). This was my first project after I took a bootcamp that lasted one month on Frontend Web Development. Here we grasped the basics of html, css, the box model, and a brief introduction to responsive web design.
